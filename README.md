During the last decades, considerable progress has been made in the development of quantum computers, and a breakthrough in this field will have massive application in our society, particularily in research, cryptography and logistic. Google and IBM recently claimed the creation of a 72 and 50 qubit quantum chips respectively, making the likelihood for a potential quantum supremacy even more likely.

In May 2016, IBM launched Quantum Experience (QX), which enables anyone to easily connect to the 5qubit IBMâ€™s quantum processors via the IBM Cloud to run algorithms and experiments. Along with it's platform, IBM also developped QISKit, a Python library for the Quantum Experience API, where Useres can more easily apply quantum gates to qubit.
