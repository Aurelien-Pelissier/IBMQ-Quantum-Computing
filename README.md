During the last decades, considerable progress has been made in the development of quantum computers, and a breakthrough in this field will have massive application in our society, particulaily in research, cryptography and logistic.  

In May 2016, IBM launched Quantum Experience (QX), which enables anyone to easily connect to IBMâ€™s quantum processors via the IBM Cloud, to run algorithms and experiments. IBM developped QISKit, a Python library for the Quantum Experience API. It is now possible to implement ourself qauntum algorithms using quantum logic gates.
